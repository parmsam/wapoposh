Use R to access **Wa**shington **Po**st **Po**lice **Sh**ootings dataset. Provides convenient functions to spend less time data wrangling and more time generating findings.

## Installation

You can install the development version of wapoposh from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("parmsam/wapoposh")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to interact with the dataset:

```{r example, message = FALSE}
library(wapoposh)
library(dplyr)
# basic example code
tail(policeshootings, 4)
```

```{r glimpse, message = FALSE}
glimpse(policeshootings)
```

You can use `latest_data()` to get the latest dataset from the Washington Post [Github repo](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings). 
```{r latest, message = FALSE}
# get latest data
latest <- latest_data()
tail(latest, 4)
```

## Update Frequency 

Note that the repo is scheduled to update the package data on a weekly basis. However, it will require a reinstall to pull the latest processed data (.rda) file. As an alternative, the `latest_data()` function will pull most current public dataset from the Washington Post.

## Credit

Credit goes to the Washington Post and their research and reporting/database development team for compiling and sharing the dataset on their [Github repo](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings).
