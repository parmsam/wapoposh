\description{
The Washington Post has been compiling a database of every fatal shooting in the United States by a police officer in the line of duty since 2015. The Post created version 2 of this dataset in 2022 to refine and better define data categories, as well as improve documentation about how the data is obtained and classified. In addition to the altering of fields and formatting, a separate agencies dataset has been added which includes information on the law enforcement agencies which have been involved in at least one fatal shooting since 2015. Death record data about each incident and victim. The file can be downloaded at this URL. Victim information is obtained from any available recordings of the incident, news accounts, court records and/or official statements.
